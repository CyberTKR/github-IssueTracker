## Usage

When the application is running, changes in the issues section of a specific Github repository are checked at regular intervals. If a new issue is created, an email notification is sent. Gmail is used to send the email, and the sender email address and password should be specified in the `tracker.py` file.

To use the application, you need to provide a valid Github API access token in the `tracker.py` file. You also need to provide your Gmail account information in the `tracker.py` file to send the email notifications. If your Gmail account uses two-factor authentication, you will need to create an application-specific password to allow the application to access your account.
